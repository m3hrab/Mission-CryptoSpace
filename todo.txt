# Mission CryptoSpace (Crypternity)

## Game Theme
Encryption-themed escape game set in space on Mars where an astronaut must decrypt RSA messages to open doors and exit the space station.

## Scenario

You are an astronaut and cryptographic security analyst, alone aboard a Martian space station. The rest of the crew is on a mission in the Valles Marineris canyon. You were in charge of an experimental project: encrypting vital systems using advanced security algorithms.

Suddenly, an alarm goes off: there's a breach in the station! Your spacesuit is damaged. But even stranger: the backup systems refuse to activate. A message appears on the main screen:

> "Authentication required. Decrypt the Sigma protocol."

Your systems are locked down. Every door, every terminal, every life support system is protected by an encrypted code. You must decrypt these codes to survive: repair your suit, access emergency oxygen, activate the radio beacon.

As a last hope, you pick up a faint signal: the Earth lander has crashed, but it contained fragments of encryption keys. It's up to you to find them, reassemble them, and send a clear distress message before it's too late.
